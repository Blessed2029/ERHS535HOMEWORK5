##  Overview

This repository contains all files associated with Homework 5 for ERHS 535.  
The assignment required the creation of a reproducible GitHub repository, an
R Project, an RMarkdown document, and a final visualization based on the
Washington Post homicide dataset.

For this homework, I selected **Choice 2**, which required recreating a
time-series visualization of monthly homicides in Baltimore, including:

- Cold vs. warm month seasonal coloring  
- A smoothed trend line  
- A vertical reference line marking the **Arrest of Freddie Gray** (April 12, 2015)  
- A dark-theme background and professional graphical formatting  

All processing, analysis, and visualization were completed in R using `tidyverse`,
`lubridate`, and `ggplot2`.
